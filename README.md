# optimization

Introduction to optimization algorithms. In some cases, this code can refer to the functions implemented in the [combheuristics](https://github.com/jmsallan/combheuristics) package.

The present contents of the repository are:

* **GA:** An introduction to genetic algorithms (GA) using R and MATLAB.
* **Flowshop:** Some developments for the permutative flowshop problem (PFS). In **GA\_flowshop** there is code implementing and testing the functionalities of the **GA** R package for the PFS. In **GRASP\_ILS** and **SA** there are implementations of local search algorithms.
